*BUILT BY SIDIOUSVIC, ENGINEER @ CODE CHRYSALIS 🐛*


## Contribute

1. **Clone the repo** `git clone https://github.com/sidiousvic/yopardy.git`

2. **Make a feature branch** `git checkout -b <myfeature>`

3. `yarn start` **and hack away**

At this point, I reccomend you take a while to understand how state is implemented with [`zustand`](https://github.com/react-spring/zustand). Try your best to stay consistent with the current use.

4. **Commit often and atomically** ⚠️

5. **PR against master, assign** `@sidiousvic` **for review**
